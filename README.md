# Iris-clustering
Prediction using unsupervised machine learning

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, the optimum number of clusters are predicted and represented visually.

Kmeans clustering algorithm is used for this prediction

Steps:
1. Importing necessary modules
2. Loading the iris dataset
3. Finding the optimum number of clusters
4. Training the model
5. Visualising the model
